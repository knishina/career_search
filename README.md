# career_search
This folder, `career_search`, contains work from a group project.  The purpose of this project was to simplify the job hunt.  The application scrapes two popular job posting sites and takes in the user preference for job title, current address, and the amount of time willing to travel to a job location.  The application takes these inputs into consideration as well as key words that may be found in the job description; the application is also built to eliminate postings from recruiters.  The output of this application are the top ten recommended jobs for the user.
